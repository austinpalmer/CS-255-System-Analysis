# CS-255-System-Analysis
This repository includes professional documents created in my SNHU System Analysis course

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project where you analyze the needs of your client DriverPass to develop an app to help new drivers pass their driver's test. The system needed to be client-server based and hosted on a web page. On this page, a student could create/edit driving practice reservations, take practice tests, and view account details. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I did well on my buisness requirments documents and research into what would make this system optimal.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise parts of my diagrams in my system diagram document. There could be more added to these diagrams to make them a better depiction of the system's needs. I would add more to my UML diagram to address the admin side of the system better.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user needs were a priority when designing this system and this can be shown through how many functions the system offers users. Additionally, the system needed to support many users at any time of the day while being accessible via mobile or desktop. These additions improve user accessibility.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software first through UML case and class diagrams and then turning these ideas into pseudocode which I can then turn into code. Before this course I did not realize the importance of diagramming but now I can see the perks especially with redesigning systems. I will start desiging a case diagram for every one of my projects.
